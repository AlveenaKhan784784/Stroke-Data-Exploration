# Stroke-Data-Exploration

### Stroke Prediction - Data Preprocessing & EDA

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze the **Stroke Prediction Dataset** to identify key factors contributing to stroke risk. The project focuses on **data preprocessing** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to clean, visualize, and understand patterns in the dataset.

## Data Preprocessing Steps:
- Handling Missing Values: BMI had 4% missing values, imputed using median (due to right-skewed distribution).
- Handling Outliers: Used box plots to detect outliers in numerical columns (e.g., age, avg_glucose_level, BMI).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Stroke vs. Age: Stroke cases were more frequent in older individuals.
- Gender vs. Stroke: Stroke rates were slightly higher in some gender categories.
- BMI Analysis: Positively skewed, median imputation was applied.
- Hypertension & Heart Disease: People with these conditions had a higher likelihood of stroke.
- Visualizations Used: Box plots, count plots, and bar charts to explore feature relationships.

## Key Insights:
- Age is a strong factor in stroke cases, with most stroke patients being elderly.
- Hypertension and heart disease are associated with an increased risk of stroke.
- Smoking status shows some variation, but further statistical testing is needed.
